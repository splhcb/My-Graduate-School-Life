## 2020.0801-0807

This week I mainly read two papers by Maldacena [1904.01911v3] and Maloney [:1905.03780v2], which discuss the de Sitter analog of SSS's proposal that JT gravity in AdS2 is dual to a random matrix model on its conformal boundary, and also lecture notes on de Sitter space [hep-th/0110007v2].

The crucial observation is that we can analytically continue the Lorentzian dS metric to (minus) Euclidean AdS metric. The genus
expansion, which is legit in R=-2 case and problematic in R=2, can be solved using the topological gauge field theory description of JT gravity, as pointed out in Maloney's paper.

I only read the essential part of the two papers, and will leave the rest for later reading.

I would like to generalize Witten's discussion of black hole phase transition in deformed JT gravity with asymptotically AdS spacetime to that in asymptotically dS spacetime. Hopefully, I will get some results next week.
