## Before 2019.9 (before becoming a PhD student)

* Physics:
  * Undergraduate physics (for sure)
  * Graduate courses on quantum mechanics, Lie groups and Lie algebras, GR and QFT (2 semesters)
  * A bit string theory, CFT and AdS/CFT
* Math:
  * Self-studied or attended most of the required undergraduate courses lectured by the math department: ODE, complex analysis, functional analysis, abstract algebra, general topology, differential geometry (curves and surfaces)



## 2019.9 to 2020.2

* New courses (apart from those already taken yet taken once again in this semester):
  * Particle physics,
  * Group theory,
  * Quantum statistics, 
  * Selected topics on QFT.

Although I had taken most of the graduate courses, I had to study them over again in the first semester, which, however, took much of my time, doing tedious and time-consuming homework and preparing for the finals. Besides, I took some new courses, much content of which had been learned before. Quantum statistics, or rather, quantum theory of many-body systems, lectured by Shindou, was quite new to me. I found it satisfying when I figured out, finally, BCS theory on superconductivity. Selected topics on QFT was lectured by my tutor, Chen. It covered non-perturbative QFT such as solitons and magnetic monopoles within half the semester, and SUSY in another, with some quick comments on renormalization and anomaly.

* Mathematics:
  * Nakahara, Geometry Topology and Physics,
  * Some basic knot theory.

After reading Nakahara’s previous chapters thoroughly, I quickly went over the chapter on index theorem (where I got confused) and skipped the last chapter on bosonic strings. Maybe I’ll come back to read these someday. Some notes on knot theory were read when I encountered Chern-Simons field theory.

* Quantum field theory:
  * Weinberg, Quantum theory of fields (vol. 1, first 5 chapters).

It’s hard to read, but it offers more fundamental thinkings on QFT. I found contents in chapter 6 and following ones quite resembling those in standard QFT textbooks so I skipped them.

* SUSY:
  * Bertolini, [Lectures on Superstring](https://people.sissa.it/~bertmat/susycourse.pdf)
  * N=2 Seiberg-Witten theory

I found Bertolini’s notes easy to read for a complete beginner to SUSY. Some introductory notes on N=2 Seiberg-Witten theory were read for a homework project.

* AdS/CFT: 
  * M. Natsuume, AdS/CFT Duality User Guide, [1409.3575](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3575)

I was still not familiar with AdS/CFT at this time, and I quickly scanned over first few chapters of this book for review.

* CFT and CFT bootstrap: 
  * Francesco et al., Conformal Field Theory, vol. 1,
  * Rychkov, EPFL Lectures on Conformal Field Theory in D >= 3 Dimensions, [1601.05000](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05000)
  * D. Simons-Duffin, TASI notes on conformal bootstrap, [1602.07982](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07982)

Volume 1 of "Yellow book" was read thoroughly. Rychkov's notes and bootstrap were read during the winter break.

* Bosonic string theory: 
  * D. Tong, Lectures on String Theory, [0908.0333](https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0333)

I had read it in undergraduate years for the first time. It is far less formidable than standard textbooks, say, Polchinski. However, much of its content was completely forgotten and I had to read again.

* Loop quantum gravity:
  * Pietro Doná and Simone Speziale, Introductory lectures to loop quantum gravity, [1007.0402](https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.0402)

I did not spend much time on this. I read through and grasped some of the basic ideas.

* Research on reflected entanglement entropy in Lifshitz field theory tutored by Clément

We failed to calculate the final results. I also read about Chern-Simons field theory but the reflected entropy of it seemed as hard.


## 2020.3
* CQFT:
  * Wightman, PCT, Spin and Statistics, and all that.

I scanned over the whole book very quickly. There is still many much more to learn regarding this field.

* Integrability:
  * J. Lamers, A pedagogical introduction to quantum integrability, [1501.06805](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06805).

Quite preliminary notes on Bethe ansatz.

* Superstring:
  * Esko Keski-Vakkuri and Fawad Hassan, [Introduction to Superstring Theory](http://www.courses.physics.helsinki.fi/teor/saie/saikeet050520.pdf).

I finished the latter half part of the book, gaining some basic pictures on superstring.

* Statistical physics:
  * D. Tong, [Kinetic Theory](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/kinetic.html),
  * D. Tong, [Statistical Field Theory](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/sft.html).

I read the kinetic theory and stochastic process part of the first note. Classical theories are as fascinating as quantum ones. The second note on statistical field theory gave me some background stories for CFT, which I had not paid much attention to before.

* Condensed matter theory:
  * D. Tong, [The Quantum Hall Effects](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/qhe.html)

Intensive lecture notes on integral and fractional quantum hall effects, which provides a specific example of bulk/boundary (dS/CFT) correspondence.
