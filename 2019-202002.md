## Before 2019.9 (before becoming a PhD student)

* Physics:
  * Undergraduate physics (for sure)
  * Graduate courses on quantum mechanics, Lie groups and Lie algebras, GR and QFT (2 semesters)
  * A bit string theory, CFT and AdS/CFT
* Math:
  * Self-studied or attended most of the required undergraduate courses lectured by the math department: ODE, complex analysis, functional analysis, abstract algebra, general topology, differential geometry (curves and surfaces)



## 2019.9 to 2020.2

* New courses (apart from those already taken yet taken once again in this semester):
  * Particle physics,
  * Group theory,
  * Quantum statistics, 
  * Selected topics on QFT.

Although I had taken most of the graduate courses, I had to study them over again in the first semester, which, however, took much of my time, doing tedious and time-consuming homework and preparing for the finals. Besides, I took some new courses, much content of which had been learned before. Quantum statistics, or rather, quantum theory of many-body systems, lectured by Shindou, was quite new to me. I found it satisfying when I figured out, finally, BCS theory on superconductivity. Selected topics on QFT was lectured by my tutor, Chen. It covered non-perturbative QFT such as solitons and magnetic monopoles within half the semester, and SUSY in another, with some quick comments on renormalization and anomaly.

* Mathematics:
  * Nakahara, Geometry Topology and Physics,
  * Some basic knot theory.

After reading Nakahara’s previous chapters thoroughly, I quickly went over the chapter on index theorem (where I got confused) and skipped the last chapter on bosonic strings. Maybe I’ll come back to read these someday. Some notes on knot theory were read when I encountered Chern-Simons field theory.

* Quantum field theory:
  * Weinberg, Quantum theory of fields (vol. 1, first 5 chapters).

It’s hard to read, but it offers more fundamental thinkings on QFT. I found contents in chapter 6 and following ones quite resembling those in standard QFT textbooks so I skipped them.

* SUSY:
  * Bertolini, [Lectures on Superstring](https://people.sissa.it/~bertmat/susycourse.pdf)
  * N=2 Seiberg-Witten theory

I found Bertolini’s notes easy to read for a complete beginner to SUSY. Some introductory notes on N=2 Seiberg-Witten theory were read for a homework project.

* AdS/CFT: 
  * M. Natsuume, AdS/CFT Duality User Guide, [1409.3575](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3575)

I was still not familiar with AdS/CFT at this time, and I quickly scanned over first few chapters of this book for review.

* CFT and CFT bootstrap: 
  * Francesco et al., Conformal Field Theory, vol. 1,
  * Rychkov, EPFL Lectures on Conformal Field Theory in D >= 3 Dimensions, [1601.05000](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05000)
  * D. Simons-Duffin, TASI notes on conformal bootstrap, [1602.07982](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07982)

Volume 1 of "Yellow book" was read thoroughly. Rychkov's notes and bootstrap were read during the winter break.

* Bosonic string theory: 
  * D. Tong, Lectures on String Theory, [0908.0333](https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0333)

I had read it in undergraduate years for the first time. It is far less formidable than standard textbooks, say, Polchinski. However, much of its content was completely forgotten and I had to read again.

* Loop quantum gravity:
  * Pietro Doná and Simone Speziale, Introductory lectures to loop quantum gravity, [1007.0402](https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.0402)

I did not spend much time on this. I read through and grasped some of the basic ideas.

* Research on Reflected Entropy in Lifshitz field theory tutored by Clément

We failed to calculate the final results. I also read about Chern-Simons field theory but the reflected entropy of it seemed as hard.
