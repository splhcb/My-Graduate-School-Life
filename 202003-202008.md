## 2020.3
* CQFT:
  * Wightman, PCT, Spin and Statistics, and all that.

I scanned over the whole book very quickly. There is still many much more to learn regarding this field.

* Integrability:
  * J. Lamers, A pedagogical introduction to quantum integrability, [1501.06805](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06805).

Quite preliminary notes on Bethe ansatz.

* Superstring:
  * Esko Keski-Vakkuri and Fawad Hassan, [Introduction to Superstring Theory](http://www.courses.physics.helsinki.fi/teor/saie/saikeet050520.pdf).

I finished the latter half part of the book, gaining some basic pictures on superstring.

* Statistical physics:
  * D. Tong, [Kinetic Theory](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/kinetic.html),
  * D. Tong, [Statistical Field Theory](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/sft.html).

I read the kinetic theory and stochastic process part of the first note. Classical theories are as fascinating as quantum ones. The second note on statistical field theory gave me some background stories for CFT, which I had not paid much attention to before.

* Condensed matter theory:
  * D. Tong, [The Quantum Hall Effects](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/qhe.html)

Intensive lecture notes on integral and fractional quantum hall effects, which provides a specific example of bulk/boundary (dS/CFT) correspondence. 

## 2020.4

Almost spent whole April (and half of May) playing Nintendo Switch :(

* AdS/CFT:
  * Eric D’Hokera and Daniel Z. Freedmanb, Supersymmetric Gauge Theories and
the AdS/CFT Correspondence, TASI 2001 Lecture Notes, [hep-th/0201253](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0201253),

Introductory notes on AdS5/N=4 SYM focusing on the field theory side.

* Chern-Simons Theory:
  * Umang Mehta, [Chern Simons Theory and Rational CFT on
Manifolds with Boundary](http://theory.uchicago.edu/~sethi/Teaching/P483-W2018/Chern%20Simons%20and%20CFT%20-%20Umang.pdf)



Explains quite clearly why quantization of Chern-Simons theory leads to the same form of WZW model on the boundary. 


*  Reflected Entropy of Chern-Simons theory:

I followed Clément's calculation on Reflected Entropy of Chern-Simons theory, and worked on the remaining calculations and some of the figures.
