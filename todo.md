* More on AdS/CFT, maldacena's review
* Optional: 
  * aqft,
  * cqft 
* Math:
  * Ricci flow and geometry
  * algebraic geometry
  * more on representation theory
  * functional analysis review

* Specific problems
  * Holomorphy and non-renormalization theorems in susy (done)
  * minimal surface and entanglement entropy, entanglement wedge cross section
